# AI Survey Response Analyzer
Cloud-native survey tool and feedback analyzer built with Next.js, TypeScript, Stripe, Clerk, PostHog, and Sentry. 
> Designed to collect user responses directly from websites and automatically generate summaries using integrated AI analysis. Processes user feedback through data pipelines including structured
> response aggregation and AI-driven summarization.
> User authentication is managed via Clerk, monetization is handled via
> Stripe billing, and the entire platform is deployed to Vercel.
